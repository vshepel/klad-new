                        Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which
                        can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                        settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, we may use GPS and other
                        technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                        address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access
                        to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you
                        choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
